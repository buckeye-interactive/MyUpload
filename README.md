# Building a Docker image for your organization

In order to build a custom Docker image for your organization, you must have at least `docker` installed. There are convenience scripts written that will build and deploy the images as long as you have `make` installed.

Clone the repository, navigate to the `build` directory and run this make command:

`make release PRIMARY_COLOR=#ff0000 WEB_REPO_NAME=user/myupload` - Replacing `PRIMARY_COLOR` and `WEB_REPO_NAME` with your organization's primary color and docker repository.

This creates a customized Docker image and uploads it to your Docker Repository

# Running your customized Docker image

The simplest way to run your new image is to use the `docker-compose` files that are in the `build` folder. There are 3 different docker-compose files based on what type of environment you are running in:

- docker-compose: This is the default script and should be run only in development.
- staging.docker-compose: Should be run on staging sites.
- production.docker-compose: Should be run on production sites.

There are many different environment varibles that can be used to customize the application. The simplest way to add environment variables is to create a `env.mk` file in the `build` folder. The following is an example of a production `env.mk` file:

```
export REGISTRY_URL=buckii/myupload
export COMPOSE_FILE=production.docker-compose.yml
export EXPOSE_PORT=3000
export APP_URL=https://production-url.com
export APP_NAME=MyUpload
export DB_HOST=db
export DB_DATABASE=myupload
export DB_USERNAME=myupload_admin
export DB_PASSWORD=change_password
export DB_PORT=5432
export MAIL_DRIVER=mailgun
export MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mg.example.com
export MAILGUN_SECRET=your-mailgun-secret
export MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=info@myupload.com
export MAIL_FROM_NAME=MyUpload
export MEMCACHED_HOST=memcached
export CACHE_DRIVER=memcached
export SESSION_DRIVER=memcached
export RECAPTCHA_SITE=your-recapcha-site-key
export RECAPTCHA_SECRET=your-recapcha-site-secret
export GA_PROPERTY_ID=your-GA-id
export PRIMARY_COLOR=\#de5431
export LOGO=https://mysite.com/logo.png
export COPYRIGHT=Copyright Â© 2020 Company Name. All rights reserved.
export CONTACT_INFORMATION=Street Address, City, State Zip (Phone Number)
export USAGE_VERBIAGE=I authorize Company Name to use these images
```

After creating this `env.mk` file, running `make up` from the `build` folder will create all of the Docker services listed in the docker compose file. (`make down` does the opposite, stopping and removing all docker containers listed in the compose file)

Once the docker containers are running, the last thing that needs to happen is proxying all requests to the exposed port in the `env.mk` file. This can be done with a web server running on the server that you are hosting the docker containers on. The recommended web server for this is Nginx.

## Initial Database Setup

Once the site is running, all of the tables for the database need to be created. In order to do that, first start a bash shell in the docker container by running `make web-shell`. Once a bash shell is running, any Laravel artisan commands can be run (documentation here: https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/artisan).

In this case, we want to run `php artisan migrate --seed`, which will run all of the database migrations and seed the database with 1 admin user. This user's email is `admin@test.com` and its password is `password`. This email / password can be changed by logging into the portal (via the /login route) and visiting the account settings page.
